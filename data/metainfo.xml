      Peg solitaire, Solo Noble or simply Solitaire is a board game for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. 
      Some sets use marbles in a board with indentations. 
      The game is known as solitaire in Britain and as peg solitaire in the US where 'solitaire' is now the common name for patience. 
      It is also called Brainvita in India, where sets are sold commercially under this name.
